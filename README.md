BananaKit

BananaKit is an appealing abstraction of common patterns and tools that were extracted from some of the largest and most successful apps in the app store.

Upcoming subprojects:

- CoreBanana: A semi-persistence framework. Your data decays over a period of 3-4 days and bruises easily when manipulated.
- Split: A/B testing. Works best on a Sunday, when there is lower usage.
- Smoothie: Integration testing tools. Slippin up bugs one at a time.
- AsyncBanana: Easy to use wrappers for GCD and NSOperation

Originally developed by [@modocache](https://twitter.com/modocache), BananaKit is also an indispensible cluster of concepts for talking about code.
